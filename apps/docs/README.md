# Cal.com Documentation

The official product, support and developer documentation, containing information and guides about using the product as well as support for self-hosted installations. This documentation site runs on [Nextra](https://nextra.vercel.app), so you may refer to their documentation should you need information on anything that isn't covered here.

## Prerequisites

- Git
- Node.js & npm
- Yarn

## Installation

Firstly, clone the repository using Git:

```console
git clone https://github.com/calcom/docs.git
```

Now, you can install the dependencies with yarn:

```console
yarn install
```

## Editing

To create, edit and delete documentation pages, you can simply create markdown (.mdx) files in the `pages/` folder. You can edit Markdown with any text editor, but VS Code and WebStorm have side-by-side previews so you can see your formatted content whilst writing markdown.

You will also need to add it as an entry to the `meta.json` file found in whichever directory that the .mdx file is in.

## Local Development

```console
yarn dev
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

```console
yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static content hosting service.
