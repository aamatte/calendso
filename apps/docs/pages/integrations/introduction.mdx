## How to choose the primary Calendar?

If you have two or more integrated calendars and you want your events to show in only one, you can define a primary calendar like this:

1. Go to your [Integrations](https://app.cal.com/integrations) page.
2. Next to your `Calendars` you will see a dropdown that says `Create events on:`.
3. Select your primary calendar.
