## Removing Permissions for Cal to access your Microsoft Workplace Account

Hover over Cal.com in the my apps portal, then select `manage your application`.

The top part of permissions window shows what you personally consented to. Examples of apps permissions include the ability to access your calendar, contacts, or camera.

You can revoke any of the permissions you consented to by selecting `Revoke Permissions`, however removing a permission may break some of the apps functionality. If you have problems after you remove permissions or accounts, contact your organization's Helpdesk for additional assistance.

If you require more help, head over the Microsoft Documentation Page about [Managing Applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/user-help/my-applications-portal-permissions-saved-accounts)
