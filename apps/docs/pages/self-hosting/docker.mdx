# Docker

The Docker configuration for Cal is an effort powered by people within the community. Cal does not provide official support for Docker, but we will accept fixes and documentation. Use at your own risk.

The Docker configuration can be found [in our docker repository](https://github.com/calcom/docker).

## Requirements

Make sure you have `docker` & `docker-compose` installed on the server / system.

## Getting Started

### Option #1: Docker Hub

   ```bash
   docker pull calendso/calendso
   ```

or

### Option #2: Cloning

1. Clone calendso-docker

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:calendso/calendso-docker.git --recursive
   ```

2. Update `.env` if needed

3. Build and start calendso

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

4. Start prisma studio
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec calendso -- npx prisma studio
   ```
5. Open a browser to [port 5555](http://localhost:5555) on your localhost to look at or modify the database content.

6. Click on the `User` model to add a new user record.
